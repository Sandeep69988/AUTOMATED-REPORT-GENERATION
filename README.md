##

  **  I Have created a Automated report generation.
  ** for this first I installed libraries which are required for this task like reportlab,pandas.
  ** then i created a folder  for my project Inside that folder i kept the python script which 
       > Checks for a CSV file.

       > If not found, creates a sample CSV file.

      >  Loads the data from the CSV.

      > Generates a PDF report from the data.


  ** After the script runs:

     > A new PDF file will be created in the same folder named: report.pdf
     
  **   Open it to see a simple report with:

      > Title: Automated System Report

      > Current date & time

      > A table with device data


  **  Designed clean, readable, and well-documented code with proper error handling
